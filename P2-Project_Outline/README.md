## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Currently, if anyone in my department needs any information from the database team, ie. mailing lists, reports, etc. they either submit a very confusing infopath form or send an email because they don't want to use the infopath form.
I'd like to create an easy to use form, and track the progress of each request.  The users requesting the information will be able to see when the report will be completed, and the users completing the requests will be able to view their assignments
or tasks assigned to them for completion. Priority status' can be added to alert the database team of an urgent request.

### Features
As a user I want to be able to login so that I can access my user profile using user authentication.
As a user I also want to be able to submit an online form, and have the information write to a database. I'd also like
the data requests I've submitted to the database team to display as a list on my home page.
As a user who will fulfill the data requests I want to be able to access the database requests I need to complete, and be notified
via email when a new request has been submitted.
